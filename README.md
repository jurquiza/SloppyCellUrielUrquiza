# SloppyCellUrielUrquiza
changes in sloppyCell for working with clock models and absolute units constraints

I used this version of Sloppycell during my PhD at Edinburgh University in the Lab of Andrew Millar. SloppyCell was hacked 
for allowing easier work with clock models that require constrains for period and amplitude. Also for introducing
constraints in aboslute units or composion of constraints for parmaters like ratios
